# Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services like storage, processing power, and software over the internet. This eliminates the need for physical hardware and allows businesses to scale resources as needed.

## Key Benefits:

- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay for what you use, instead of maintaining expensive infrastructure.
- **Accessibility**: Access your data and services from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Types of Cloud Services:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2).
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools for application development (e.g., Google App Engine).
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Software provided over the internet (e.g., Gmail, Dropbox).
