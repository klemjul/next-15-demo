# Understanding Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts:

- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data and make predictions.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms find patterns in data without predefined labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback.

## Popular ML Algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values.
- **Decision Trees**: A flowchart-like structure for decision-making.
- **Neural Networks**: Algorithms inspired by the human brain used in deep learning.
